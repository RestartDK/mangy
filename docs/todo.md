# Todo List

- [x] First deploy to Dokploy both backend and frontend

## Calendar View

- [x] Sync with Google Calendar (read and write)
- [x] Support recurring events
- [x] CRUD events on the calendar
- [x] Drag events to reschedule
- [x] Expand/shrink events by dragging edges
- [x] Click event to edit via popup
- [x] Add event button with popup

Problems:

- [x] Remove the bar on top of the page with old better auth ui elements
- [x] There is no login page, need to use the one from shadcn as a default one
- [x] There should be a header, but there should just be the profile picture with a dropdown with settings and log out
- [x] fix the ui to use the shadcn defaults for consistent styling

- [x] When dragging every event it will have the popup menu come up when you finish dragging, should not have a popup
- [x] Need to add localstorage settings for setting the specific view you have like month or week so it persists on reload
- [x] The text on the calendar should not be centered but be aligned at the top
- [x] The calendar grid is not scrollable at the moment, must be scrollable
- [x] Don't allow for a hover over every event to change colour on calendar grid, users should double tap to add a new event
- [x] Fix dragging to be better visually
- [x] Make sure to show ui of calendar grid first, then load events don't block ui

- [x] fix ui of dropdown menu with spacing of elements, maybe need to check agin dropdown menu defaults
- [x] add `env.ts` to make sure env variables are handled properly

## Chat Interface

- [x] Collapsible panel
- [x] Streaming text responses
- [x] SSE for tool calls with the following tools:
  - [x] Create event
  - [x] Read events
  - [x] Update event
  - [x] Delete event
  - [x] Query calendar (free time, what's on a given day, etc.)
  - [x] Get user information
- [x] Calendar change preview (user confirms before changes apply)
- [x] Context: sliding window of past 2 responses + relevant calendar data

## Submission cleanup

- [x] Fix README.md with project description and clear setup
- [x] Allow for multiple calendars to be available from google calendar
- [x] Refactor and cleanup any duplicated schemas and the ai part works well
- [ ] Film demo video going through the app
